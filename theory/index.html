Since we are interested in real situation we will restrict to the case <span>$d \in \{2, 3\}$</span>; however the following description could be simply enlarged for a general <span>$d$</span> value.</p><p>Suppose we want to build is something like &quot;the shape formed by these points&quot;. Of course it could be done in many ways: <span>$\alpha$</span> shapes are one of them.</p><p>As Edelbrunner and Mücke said in their paper [1] <span>$\alpha$</span> shapes could be thinked as the following. Imagine a huge mass of ice-cream making up the space <span>$\mathbb R^d$</span> and containing the points <span>$S$</span> as &quot;hard&quot; chocolate pieces. Using one of these sphere-formed ice-cream spoons we carve out all parts of the ice-cream block we can reach without bumping into chocolate pieces, thereby even carving out holes in the inside (<em>eg.</em> parts not reachable by simply moving the spoon from the outside). We will eventually end up with a (not necessarily convex) object bounded by caps, arcs and points; we will call this object <span>$\alpha$</span>-hull of <span>$S$</span>. If we now straighten all &quot;round&quot; faces to triangles and line segments, we have an intuitive description of what is called the <span>$\alpha$</span>-shape of <span>$S$</span>, denoted by <span>$\mathcal T$</span>.</p><p>But what is <span>$\alpha$</span> after all? In the ice-cream analogy above, <span>$\alpha$</span> is the squared radius of the carving spoon. A very small value will allow us to eat up all of the ice-cream except the chocolate points themselves. Thus for <span>$\alpha \to 0$</span> the alpha shape degenerates to the sites set <span>$S$</span>. On the other hand, a huge value of <span>$\alpha$</span> will prevent us even from moving the spoon between two points since it is too large and we will never spoon up the ice-cream lying in the inside of the convex hull of <span>$S$</span>. Hence, the <span>$\alpha$</span>-shape becomes the convex hull of <span>$S$</span> as <span>$\alpha \to \infty$</span>.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Gemoetrical-Concept-1" href="#Gemoetrical-Concept-1">Gemoetrical Concept</a></h2><p>We will shortly discuss all the geometrical concepts that are needed to understand what an <span>$\alpha$</span>-shape is.</p><p>In the following we assume that the set of sites <span>$S$</span> is made of points in a general position (no <span>$d+2$</span> points of <span>$S$</span> lie on a common ball). Of course this condition is not general (regardless of the name); however there’s a technique called SoS which &quot;simulates an infinitesimal perturbation of the points&quot;, so that they are in general position afterwards.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="\\alpha-hulls-and-\\alpha-diagrams-1" href="#\\alpha-hulls-and-\\alpha-diagrams-1"><span>$\alpha$</span>-hulls and <span>$\alpha$</span>-diagrams</a></h3><p>First of all we need to identify what the spoon of the introduction is.</p><div class="admonition definition"><div class="admonition-title">Definition</div><div class="admonition-text"><p>For each <span>$0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \infty$</span> let an <span>$\alpha$</span>-ball be an open ball with radius <span>$\alpha$</span>.

For completenes we could therefore impose that <span>$B_x(0)$</span> represents the point <span>$x$</span>.
