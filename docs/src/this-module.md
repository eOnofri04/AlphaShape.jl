# 4.0 - Module Introduction

In this module we have solved the problem of building an ``alpha``-complex for a generical dimension. However the module could only solve two and three dimensional istances of the problem. The reason is that no library for ``d``-dimensional Delaunay Triangulation exists in Julia so far.

In [section 4.1]() we will discuss how we have solved the Delauanay Triangulation problem in the next section.

In [section 4.2]() we will talk about solving the problem of finding the charateristical ``\alpha`` of the simplices in order to build the ``\alpha``-Structures.

Lastly, in [section 4.3]() we will give a brief overview of how we solved the Persistent Homology problem.
