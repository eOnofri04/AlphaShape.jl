Suppose we want to build is something like &quot;the shape formed by these points&quot;. Of course it could be done in many ways: <span>$\alpha$</span> shapes are one of them.</p><p>As Edelbrunner and Mücke said in their paper [1] <span>$\alpha$</span> shapes could be thinked as the following. Imagine a huge mass of ice-cream making up the space <span>$\mathbb R^d$</span> and containing the points <span>$S$</span> as &quot;hard&quot; chocolate pieces. Using one of these sphere-formed ice-cream spoons we carve out all parts of the ice-cream block we can reach without bumping into chocolate pieces, thereby even carving out holes in the inside (<em>eg.</em> parts not reachable by simply moving the spoon from the outside). We will eventually end up with a (not necessarily convex) object bounded by caps, arcs and points; we will call this object <span>$\alpha$</span>-hull of <span>$S$</span>. If we now straighten all &quot;round&quot; faces to triangles and line segments, we have an intuitive description of what is called the <span>$\alpha$</span>-shape of <span>$S$</span>.</p><p>But what is <span>$\alpha$</span> after all? In the ice-cream analogy above, <span>$\alpha$</span> is the squared radius of the carving spoon. A very small value will allow us to eat up all of the ice-cream except the chocolate points themselves. Thus for <span>$\alpha \to 0$</span> the alpha shape degenerates to the sites set <span>$S$</span>. On the other hand, a huge value of <span>$\alpha$</span> will prevent us even from moving the spoon between two points since it is too large and we will never spoon up the ice-cream lying in the inside of the convex hull of <span>$S$</span>. Hence, the <span>$\alpha$</span>-shape becomes the convex hull of <span>$S$</span> as <span>$\alpha \to \infty$</span>.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Introduction-1" href="#Introduction-1">Introduction</a></h2><p>In the following we assume that the set of sites <span>$S$</span> is made of points in a general position (no <span>$d+2$</span> points of <span>$S$</span> lie on a common ball). Of course this condition is not general (regardless of the name); however there’s a technique called SoS which &quot;simulates an infinitesimal perturbation of the points&quot;, so that they are in general position afterwards.</p><p>First of all we need to identify what the spoon of the introduction is.</p><div class="admonition definition"><div class="admonition-title">Definition</div><div class="admonition-text"><p>For each <span>$0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \infty$</span> let an <span>$\alpha$</span>-ball be an open ball with radius <span>$\alpha$</span>. We will identify with <span>$B_x(\alpha)$</span> the <span>$\alpha$</span>-ball centered in <span>$x$</span>. For completenes we could therefore impose that <span>$B_x(0)$</span> represents the point <span>$x$</span>. Now, a certain <span>$\alpha$</span>-ball <span>$B$</span> (at a given location) is called empty if <span>$bB \cap S = \emptyset$</span>.</p></div></div><p>We can then define what an <span>$\alpha$</span>-hull is, using the previous definition.</p><div class="admonition definition"><div class="admonition-title">Definition</div><div class="admonition-text"><p>For each <span>$0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \infty$</span> we define the <span>$\alpha$</span>-hull <span>$\mathcal H_\alpha$</span> of <span>$S$</span> as the complement of the union of all empty <span>$\alpha$</span>-balls:</p><div>\[    \mathcal H_\alpha := \overline{ \bigcup_{x \in \mathbb R^d} \{D_\alpha(x) \mid D_\alpha(x) \cap S = \emptyset \} }\]</div></div></div><p>It follows from the previous definition the following three facts:</p><ul><li><p>if <span>$\alpha_1 \leq \alpha_2$</span> then <span>$\mathcal H_{\alpha_1} \subseteq \mathcal H_{\alpha_2}$</span>;</p></li><li><p>for <span>$\alpha\to\infty$</span> we obtain that <span>$\mathcal H_\alpha$</span> corresponds to the convex hull of <span>$S$</span>;</p></li><li><p><span>$\mathcal H_0 = S$</span> since only the sites are considered.</p></li></ul><p>One more usefull concept related to what we are introducing is the <span>$\alpha$</span>-diagramm defined as follows</p><div class="admonition definition"><div class="admonition-title">Definition</div><div class="admonition-text"><p>For each <span>$0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \infty$</span> we define the <span>$\alpha$</span>-diagram <span>$\mathcal U_\alpha$</span> of <span>$S$</span> as the the union of all the <span>$\alpha$</span>-balls centered in the sites of <span>$S$</span>:</p><div>\[    \mathcal U_\alpha :=  \bigcup_{s \in S} D_\alpha(s)\]</div></div></div><p>It is pretty clear that there is a strict relation between <span>$\mathcal H_\alpha$</span> and <span>$\mathcal U_\alpha$</span>.
