Since we are interested in real situation we will restrict to the case <span>$D \in \{2, 3\}$</span>; however the following description could be simply enlarged for a general <span>$D$</span> value.</p><p>Suppose we want to build is something like &quot;the shape formed by these points&quot;. Of course it could be done in many ways: <span>$\alpha$</span>-shapes are one of them.</p><p>Suppose than that we want to take this <span>$\alpha$</span>-shape and we want to build its complete structure: in other words we want to evaluate each and every <span>$d$</span>-simplex (with <span>$d \in [0, D]$</span>) it could be made of; something like &quot;the bricks this shape is made of&quot;. This problem also could be solved in many ways: <span>$\alpha$</span>-complexes are one of them.</p><p>As Edelbrunner and Mücke said in their paper [EM92] <span>$\alpha$</span>-shapes could be thinked as the following. Imagine a huge mass of ice-cream making up the space <span>$\mathbb R^d$</span> and containing the points <span>$S$</span> as &quot;hard&quot; chocolate pieces. Using one of these sphere-formed ice-cream spoons we carve out all parts of the ice-cream block we can reach without bumping into chocolate pieces, thereby even carving out holes in the inside (<em>eg.</em> parts not reachable by simply moving the spoon from the outside). We will eventually end up with a (not necessarily convex) object bounded by caps, arcs and points; we will call this object <span>$\alpha$</span>-hull of <span>$S$</span>. If we now straighten all &quot;round&quot; faces to triangles and line segments, we have an intuitive description of what is called the <span>$\alpha$</span>-shape of <span>$S$</span>, denoted by <span>$\mathcal T$</span>.</p><p>But what is <span>$\alpha$</span> after all? In the ice-cream analogy above, <span>$\alpha$</span> is the squared radius of the carving spoon. A very small value will allow us to eat up all of the ice-cream except the chocolate points themselves. Thus for <span>$\alpha \to 0$</span> the alpha shape degenerates to the sites set <span>$S$</span>. On the other hand, a huge value of <span>$\alpha$</span> will prevent us even from moving the spoon between two points since it is too large and we will never spoon up the ice-cream lying in the inside of the convex hull of <span>$S$</span>. Hence, the <span>$\alpha$</span>-shape becomes the convex hull of <span>$S$</span> as <span>$\alpha \to \infty$</span>.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Gemoetrical-Concept-1" href="#Gemoetrical-Concept-1">Gemoetrical Concept</a></h2><p>We will shortly discuss all the geometrical concepts that are needed to understand what an <span>$\alpha$</span>-structure is.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="\\alpha-hulls-and-\\alpha-diagrams-1" href="#\\alpha-hulls-and-\\alpha-diagrams-1"><span>$\alpha$</span>-hulls and <span>$\alpha$</span>-diagrams</a></h3><p>First of all we need to identify what the spoon of the introduction is.</p><div class="admonition definition"><div class="admonition-title">Definition</div><div class="admonition-text"><p>For each <span>$0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \infty$</span> let an <span>$\alpha$</span>-ball be an open ball with radius <span>$\alpha$</span>.

What we are interested in are however complex of simplices. We therefore drop the curved edges of <span>$\alpha$</span>-hulls in favor of straight lines.</p><p>What we have described take the name of <span>$\alpha$</span>-shape of <span>$S$</span>: we will denote it <span>$\Sigma_\alpha(S)$</span> or, shortly, <span>$\Sigma$</span>. In fact it gives us a boundary of what is internal to the point cloud made of the Sites <span>$S$</span> and what is and outsider. It is trivial to understand that <span>$\Sigma$</span> is mainly made of <span>$D-1$</span>-simplices and it could not have <span>$D$</span>-simplices at all.</p><p>However <span>$\Sigma$</span> comes with a notion of Delaunay Triangulation and, since the general position condition is satisfied by hypotesis, it follows that the polytope decomposition of the <span>$\alpha$</span>-hull is unique.

In general this topic is strictly related to Persistent Homology (we will see in the next section).</p><p>The first observation we could make is that the bigger is the value <span>$\alpha$</span> the more simplices get into the complex <span>$\mathcal A$</span>.</p><p>It is although pretty clear that if a simplex is in <span>$\mathcal A$</span> for a certain <span>$\alpha$</span> than it will be in <span>$\mathcal A$</span> for every <span>$\alpha&#39; \geq \alpha$</span>. It then makes sense to search for the first value <span>$alpha$</span> such that each single simplex <span>$\sigma$</span> gets inside <span>$\mathcal A$</span>.
