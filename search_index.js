Suppose we want to build is something like \"the shape formed by these points\". Of course it could be done in many ways: alpha shapes are one of them.","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/#","page":"Teorethical Description","title":"Teorethical Description","text":"As Edelbrunner and Mücke said in their paper [1] alpha shapes could be thinked as the following. Imagine a huge mass of ice-cream making up the space mathbb R^d and containing the points S as \"hard\" chocolate pieces. Using one of these sphere-formed ice-cream spoons we carve out all parts of the ice-cream block we can reach without bumping into chocolate pieces, thereby even carving out holes in the inside (eg. parts not reachable by simply moving the spoon from the outside). We will eventually end up with a (not necessarily convex) object bounded by caps, arcs and points; we will call this object alpha-hull of S. If we now straighten all \"round\" faces to triangles and line segments, we have an intuitive description of what is called the alpha-shape of S.","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/#","page":"Teorethical Description","title":"Teorethical Description","text":"But what is alpha after all? In the ice-cream analogy above, alpha is the squared radius of the carving spoon. A very small value will allow us to eat up all of the ice-cream except the chocolate points themselves. Thus for alpha to 0 the alpha shape degenerates to the sites set S. On the other hand, a huge value of alpha will prevent us even from moving the spoon between two points since it is too large and we will never spoon up the ice-cream lying in the inside of the convex hull of S. Hence, the alpha-shape becomes the convex hull of S as alpha to infty.","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/#Introduction-1","page":"Teorethical Description","title":"Introduction","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"theory/#","page":"Teorethical Description","title":"Teorethical Description","text":"In the following we assume that the set of sites S is made of points in a general position (no d+2 points of S lie on a common ball). Of course this condition is not general (regardless of the name); however there’s a technique called SoS which \"simulates an infinitesimal perturbation of the points\", so that they are in general position afterwards.","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/#","page":"Teorethical Description","title":"Teorethical Description","text":"First of all we need to identify what the spoon of the introduction is.","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/#","page":"Teorethical Description","title":"Teorethical Description","text":"definition: Definition\nFor each 0  alpha  infty let an alpha-ball be an open ball with radius alpha.
