This library, developed during the course of (**IN540** - _Computational Applied Topology_ - 2018/19).

In a proper manner, this should be the starting point toward a future collaboration with a larger project wich is **LAR** - [_Linear Algebraic Representation_](https://github.com/cvdlab/LinearAlgebraicRepresentation.jl).

To do so, outputs are formatted in order to be simply read by [Plasm](https://github.com/cvdlab/Plasm.jl) graphic interface.

## Getting Started

To get start using this library please refere to the [Getting Started Page](https://eonofri04.github.io/AlphaShape.jl/gettingStarted.html) of the documentation.

## Structure of the Repository

 - docs: Contains all the documents related to this package.
 - examples: Contains some Sample to test the function of the package.
 - src: Source folder of the `.jl` files.
 - test: Source folder of the test `.jl` files.

## Documentation
